                        increased ability to focus, less of a wandering mind, improved arousal levels, more <br></br>
                        positive emotions, less emotional reactivity, and many other benefits.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>The mindfulness of breathing practice involves using the breath as an object of <br></br>
                        focus. It’s a great technique that anyone can do.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Breathing practices allow you to focus on the moment and focus on the breath <br></br>
                        because each moment you spend focusing on something positive is one less <br></br>
                        moment you spend focusing on something negative.</li>

                    <li>Many people breath shallower during times of stress, so learning how to breathe<br></br>

                    <br></br>   
                    <li>Breathing deeply is also a great way to shift your focus when you are feeling anxious.</li>

                    <li>The 4-7-8 breathing technique is a great technique to learn because it acts like your body’s natural tranquilizer.</li>

                    <h3>Dr. Andrew Weil’s 4-7-8 Breathing Technique</h3>
                    <br></br>  
                    <ol>
                    <li>Begin by emptying your lungs. </li>
                    <li>Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Hold your breath for 7 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Exhale firmly through your mouth, pursing the lips, for 8 seconds</li>
                    <li>You may repeat this breathing cycle up to 4 times</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br></br>
                    
                    <li>This type of simple technique is rejuvenating for the nervous system. If it makes you feel a little dizzy, <br></br>
                    don’t do any more than 3-4 breaths at first. This kind of breathing acts as a natural tranquilizer.</li>
                    <br></br>
                    <li>Practicing this kind of simple breathing can completely shift your focus and your state of mind.</li>
